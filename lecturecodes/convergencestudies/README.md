# LehrFEM++ demo codes for Chapter 3.2.3 of the Course "Numerical Methods for PDEs"

The codes in this folder correspond to the convergence studies performed in Section 3.2.3 of the "Numerical Methods for Partial Differential Equations" lecture notes. All the plots therein can be generated by this folders contents and the additional codes in the LehrFEM++ repository.

All plots generated by the Python scripts located in this folder are also saved here.


## Two-Point BVP

This example found in the file `twopointbvp.cc` performs the experiment 3.2.3.6 from the lecture nodes. A manufactured solution convergence study is performed in 1D using Linear Lagrangian FEM. The makefile target `lecturecodes.convergencestudies.twopointbvp_run` can be used to generate the corresponding plots. In total, two plots are generated:
- `1DFD2pBVPerrlin.eps`: Contains the error norms with both axes scaled linearly
- `1DFD2pBVPerrlog.eps`: Contains the error norms in a log-log plot


## Asymptotic Nature of Convergence

This example found in the file `asymptotic.cc` performs the experiment 3.2.3.12 from the lecture nodes. The 1D Poisson equation is solved with a highly oscillatory right hand side to demonstrate the asymptotic nature of convergence estimates. The makefile target `lecturecodes.convergencestudies.asymptotic_run` can be used to generate the corresponding plots. A single plot is generated:
- `linfe1dosclog.eps`: Contains the maximum, L2 and H1 error norms of the problem statement.
